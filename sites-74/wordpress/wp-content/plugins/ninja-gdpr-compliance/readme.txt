**WordPress GDPR CCPA DPA Cookie Compliance**

[LIVE DEMO](https://gdpr.ninjateam.org/)

GDPR requires businesses to protect personal user data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. And non-compliance could cost companies up to $20 million or 4% of global revenue.

Websites that collect data on citizens in European Union (EU) countries will need to comply with strict new rules around protecting customer data by May 25, 2018. Being GDPR Compliant or your business will be at risk.
 
That’s why GDPR Visual Builder - Drag and Drop to enable GDPR CCPA Compliance was born to give your website the best solution to comply with this new law.
 
<h4>Why you need GDPR Compliance?</h4>

<li>If you run a WordPress website and EU visitors can access, your site needs to be GDPR compliant.

<li>If you take advantages in using cookie, or other tracking integrations like Facebook pixels or Google Analytics, etc.</li>

<li>If you use forms like Contact 7 to collect user’s data, you need GDPR compliance.</li>

<li>If you use MailChimp or other addon to save users’ data, you need this GDPR compliance support.</li>
